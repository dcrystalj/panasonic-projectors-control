This repo is for panasonic projectors so you don't need remotes to open or close wireless projectors. In my case I was using 2 same projectors remotely.

run with ```python 3```

Project.ahk is written to automatically click on saved projector setup and start powerpoint projection. You need autohotkey to compile program and then run it as administrator.
